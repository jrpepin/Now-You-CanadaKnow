## About

These figures are my effort to learn about Canadian families, with an emphasis on gender and work. You are welcome to use them for your own teaching or learning. You can directly download the figures in .png formats or use the scripts to recreate and modify them as you desire.

## Figures

### Distribution (%) of Household Types in Canada

![Distribution (%) of Household Types in Canada](https://github.com/jrpepin/Now-You-CanadaKnow/blob/main/figs/hh.png?raw=true) [download](https://github.com/jrpepin/Now-You-CanadaKnow/blob/main/figs/hh.png) \| [code](https://github.com/jrpepin/Now-You-CanadaKnow/blob/main/R/households.R)

#### Definitions:

[**One census family**](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=fam004): a married couple and the children, if any, of either and/or both spouses; a couple living common law and the children, if any, of either and/or both partners; or a parent of any marital status in a one‑parent family with at least one child living in the same dwelling and that child or those children. All members of a particular census family live in the same dwelling. Children may be biological or adopted children regardless of their age or marital status as long as they live in the dwelling and do not have their own married spouse, common‑law partner or child living in the dwelling. Grandchildren living with their grandparent(s) but with no parents present also constitute a census family.

**Other census family households**: multiple generations of a family, two or more census families, or one census family living with additional persons not in a census family

**Roommate HH**: two or more people living together, among which none are part of a census family

**1 person**: one-person household
